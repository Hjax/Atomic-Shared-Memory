This directory contains a multitiude of custom scripts that were used in various stages of testing, as well as the CSV files that were produced as a result of these operations. 

All scripts will automatically start up the servers necessary to generate their CSV files, the scripts that were used were collect_data.py collect_data2.py, and bigservers.py

Collect_data and Collect_data2 were the standard data collection scripts that we used for a majority of our testing, the version 2 was simply an experimental bugfix on the initial version.

The bigservers file was used to measure the impact on various numbers of servers (this was used in our large number of servers scaling tests)
